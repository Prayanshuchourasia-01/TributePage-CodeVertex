        Vision of Virtual Reality
        </h1>
      <p className=''>  In the 1980s, Lanier founded VPL Research, the first company to sell VR products. He coined the term “Virtual Reality” and began building the framework that would define how we think about and experience virtual worlds. His vision extended beyond mere technology; Lanier saw VR as a way to expand human creativity and interaction, to unlock new ways of seeing and shaping the world.</p>

        <h2 className='text-center font-mono text-2xl font-bold  my-4'>Key Contributions</h2>
    <li><strong>Inventor of the Data Glove and EyePhone:</strong> Lanier and his team at VPL Research developed the Data Glove, which allowed users to interact with virtual objects using hand gestures. They also created the EyePhone, one of the earliest head-mounted displays (HMDs) designed for immersive experiences. These innovations laid the foundation for modern VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.</li>
<br />
<li><strong>Advocate for Humane Technology:</strong> While Lanier is a technological pioneer, he has also been a vocal critic of certain aspects of digital culture, particularly the impact of social media on personal well-being. His books, such as "You Are Not a Gadget" and "Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now", offer deep insights into the ethical responsibilities that come with technological advancements.</li>

    
      </ul>


      <h2 className='font-mono font-bold text-center text-3xl my-5'>Legacy</h2>
      Lanier’s work in VR development opened the door for countless industries—from gaming to medicine, education, and even space exploration—to embrace the possibilities of virtual environments. His belief in the power of VR to bring people together and solve real-world problems continues to inspire developers and creators today.
